# Nim game

## Problem explanation

Write agents able to play Nim, with an arbitrary number of rows and an upper bound "k" on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn (a.k.a., subtraction game). <br>

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects from distinct heaps or piles (rows in my implementation). On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object (in our case the goal is to take the last object).

## Task3.1: An agent using fixed rules based on nim-sum (i.e., an expert system)

Expert system wins all the time -> nim sum

## Task3.2: An agent using evolved rules

## Task3.3: An agent using minmax

## Task3.4: An agent using reinforcement learning
